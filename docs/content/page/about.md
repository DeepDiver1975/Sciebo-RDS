Against the background of the increasing digitalization of research, the importance of structured research data management (FDM) can hardly be overestimated. A recent review of the status quo of the FDM in NRW shows that there are still major gaps with regard to a professional FDM that complies with DFG recommendations (DV-ISA, 2016).

The aim of the "Sciebo Research Data Services" project is to develop a low-threshold service for the management of research data that is clearly designed as a service for scientists. The focus here will not be on developing entirely new services, but on setting up a management suite for flexible integration and coupling with existing services and systems, as well as the exemplary realisation of integrated scientific work processes (workflows) using real use cases. With the established collaboration service "sciebo - the campus cloud" (https://www.sciebo.de/projekt/index.html), a productive platform already exists that allows the shared use of services across locations. On the basis of sciebo, tools, workflows and services are to be developed to support researchers in carrying out structured research data management.

The core idea is to create bridge functionalities to pick up the researchers where they already store a large part of their data during the research process and, building on this, to provide them with easy-to-use tools, e.g. for data preparation, publication and seamless transfer to repositories or long-term archives. Connections to the CLARIN web services for the "Digital Humanities" as well as connectors for the projects Zenodo, EUDAT and for the research data repository of the University of Münster are planned. This will lead to integrated and automated work processes.

The project thus ties in well with other existing projects: As part of the "Research Data Management Organiser Project" (RDMO, https://rdmorganiser.github.io/ for short), a web application is being developed that can be operated separately and that allows "the central input and administration of the information required for sustainable data management". The developed system provides the DMP via API in machine-readable form. This is a basic prerequisite for setting up automated, end-to-end workflows. Therefore it is planned to use the RDMO for the creation of DMP as well as for the collection of project-wide parameters (license information, repository for the delivery of research data, etc.). The sciebo RDS project is the first to consistently use these features, therefore a cooperation was agreed upon. In this respect, we regard the distinct bridge functionality of sciebo RDS as an optimal complement to the ongoing activities.

It must be clearly emphasized that the aim is not to develop another repository for research data or other services in the sense of a virtual research environment. Rather, the sciebo tool, which is widely used among scientists, is to be used as an entry point for research data management and expanded to include functionalities that enable the connection and integration of existing repositories and services. The bridge function between the established work environment of the scientists and the necessary information infrastructures for the exchange, archiving and publication of research data is absolutely in the foreground in the sense of continuous work processes.
